            <p>I have extensive experience with modern C++ concepts such as move semantics, perfect forwarding,
              in this example implemting a fractal image and smart pointers. One of my notable accomplishments 
              includes implementing move semantics for a large codebase, resulting in significant performance improvements. 
              Additionally, I have utilized perfect forwarding to write flexible and efficient 
              code that handles a variety of input types. I have also demonstrated proficiency in using smart 
              pointers to manage memory and avoid common memory-related issues such as memory leaks. Overall, 
              my expertise in these areas has enabled me to write efficient, maintainable, and robust C++ code.

                <p>I recently implemented a home security alarm system that uses an infrared motion sensor and an ultrasonic light buzzer. The system is designed to detect any unusual movements or activities inside the house and alert the homeowner in case of a break-in.
                  To build the system, I first created a schematic that detailed the various components and how they would work together. I then wrote code that would activate the infrared motion sensor and trigger the ultrasonic light buzzer whenever movement was detected.
